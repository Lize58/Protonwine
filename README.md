# Protonwine
terminal-based installer for proton-ge and wine-ge (Lutris and steam only)

In this case, you just need to install "git" and "make" from your package manager, for example "sudo pacman -S git" in Arch-based distro

# Download the necessary stuff by downloading the release or cloning the repository
You can download the latest release and follow the procedures below, or you can clone the repository with "git clone https://github.com/Lize58/Protonwine"

# Entering the directory and installing the program
You must go inside protonwine's folder, you can do this graphically or via terminal with "cd Protonwine", now with terminal type "sudo make install" 

# How to use the program
Type in the terminal "protonwine" and you will have to do as the program asks.

# Reminder
I made this script with the system version of Steam and Lutris, if you're using the flatpak version, i can not guarantee that everything will work smoothly.
