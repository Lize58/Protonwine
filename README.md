# Protonwine
terminal-based installer for proton-ge and wine-ge (Lutris and steam only) 

# Installing dependecies
In this case, you just need to install git from your package manager, for example "sudo pacman -S git" in Arch-based distro

# Cloning the repository
You can do it with "git clone https://github.com/Lize58/Protonwine"

# Entering the directory and installing the program
You have to type "cd Protonwine" and "sudo make install" 

# How to use the program
Type in the terminal "protonwine" and you will have to do as the program asks.

# Reminder
I made this script with the system version of Steam and Lutris, if you're using the flatpak version, i can not guarantee that everything will work smoothly.
